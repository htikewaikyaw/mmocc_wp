### Responsive WordPress Tables
If you want your WordPress tables mobile responsive, the Tablesome plugin is the best option for you.

Tables will be fully responsive regardless of the number of rows & columns and look great on all devices including mobile devices & tablets (iPhone, Android, etc,). So it could also be called a responsive table generator.

Mobile tables automatically adjust the table column width based on the content size to fit the screen. You could also manually change the Minimum & Maximum width of the columns.

It offers 2 responsive modes:

#### 1. Horizontal Scroll Bar
A table scroll bar appears to accommodate the table when the table container width overflows. With this responsive table option, you can scroll to see more data in the table.

#### 2. Stackable Table Mode
If you choose the Stackable Table option, on mobile devices it stacks table rows under each other with one cell per row.
With table stacking, you can show each row as a list view for mobile devices.

#### Table Display Modes
You get 2 display modes for tables.  
1. Fit To Container - stretches the table to match the width of the page container 
2. Standard - table width is adjusted based on the content

### Datatables Fixed Column (Sticky Column)
In the scroll bar mode, you can fix the first column on the left side of the table. Other columns would be horizontally scrollable but the first column would be fixed.
